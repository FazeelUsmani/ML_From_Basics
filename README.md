## ML_From_Basics

This repository contains the Demo Codes for explaining Python initially and then gradually move to Machine Learning codes , so that a perfect overview of the algorithms used in Machine Learning can be explored in a very intutive manner .

### Happy Learning !!

I strongly recommend to build Math skills by learning Probability and Statistics
